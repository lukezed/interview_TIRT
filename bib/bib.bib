  abstract = {Understanding culture is essential for understanding child development, and thus for designing and evaluating interventions to improve children’s physical and mental health. We outline seven key aspects of culture, and then review the Developmental Niche, a theoretical framework created to highlight the dynamics of cultural influence on development and to guide assessment of the child’s cultural surround. Within this framework, Parental Ethnotheories are an especially important part of the psychology of caretakers, as they influence parental behavior both directly and through parents’ choices of settings and customs of care. Two examples to illustrate the usefulness of this perspective are provided. One demonstrates the cost of ignoring culture in a large-scale intervention to combat poverty in the United States; the other outlines successful use of the Developmental Niche framework in an intervention to improve infant health in Bangladesh. Together, these examples illuminate the seven aspects of culture reviewed in the introduction.},

  abstract = {Despite growing interest in supporting caregivers’ use of nurturing care globally, few parenting measures have been validated for use outside of Minority World contexts. This study aims to develop, describe, and provide validity evidence for an efficient, culturally relevant instrument to measure local nurturing parenting beliefs and behaviors regarding responsive caregiving and early learning within a sample of caregivers of 2- to 5-year-olds in Cajamarca, Peru. We used a multiple methods phased study design to develop the self-reported parenting instrument, Nurturing Parenting Beliefs and Behaviors Scale, including qualitative interviews, focus groups, cognitive testing, and quantitative pilot testing. The final validation sample included 2,274 mothers of children (Mage = 29.41 months, 49.56\% female) from Cajamarca, Peru. We used exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis to examine the factor structure of the instrument and correlations and regressions to validate it against parenting and child development outcomes. Results indicate a two-factor structure reflecting nurturing parenting beliefs (α = .84) and behaviors (α = .82). Analyses of concurrent validity showed that the parenting beliefs and behaviors subscales correlated positively with parental stimulation and learning materials. Both parenting beliefs and behaviors positively predicted early childhood development (parent report and direct assessment). This instrument can be used as a starting point for measuring parenting in other Majority World contexts with similar caregiver characteristics.

Mothers came from two independent samples from urban middle-class in Germany and California, two autonomous-relational samples from urban middle-class in India and Cameroon, and one interdependent sample from rural Cameroon. Transcriptions of picture-based interviews are coded for discourse elements indicative of both orientations. Mothers from independent and autonomous-relational samples use more I statements and direct references to themselves. Mothers from interdependent and autonomous-relational samples contextualize and refer to authorities more often. Generally, differences between the urban and rural samples in terms of discourse elements related to autonomy are less pronounced than differences in associated socialization goals. This indicates that consciously held beliefs are more sensitive to changes in the families' sociocultural environment than their discourse.},

  abstract = {This study conceptualizes a cultural model of parenting. It is argued that cultural models are expressed in the degree of familism, which informs socialization goals that are embodied in parenting ethnotheories. Three cultural models were differentiated a priori: independent, interdependent, and autonomous-related. Samples were recruited that were expected to represent these cultural models: German, Euro-American, and Greek middle-class women representing the independent cultural model; Cameroonian Nso and Gujarati farming women representing the interdependent cultural model; and urban Indian, urban Chinese, urban Mexican, and urban Costa Rican women representing the autonomous-related model. These a priori classifications were confirmed with data that addressed different levels of the cultural models of parenting. The authors further confirmed that socialization goals mediate between broader sociocultural orientations (familism) and parenting ethnotheories concerning beliefs about good parenting. The data reveal that the model of autonomous relatedness needs further theoretical and empirical refinement. Problems with empirical studies comparing participants with very different lifestyles are discussed.},

  abstract = {The definition of self and others can be regarded as embodying the two dimensions of autonomy and relatedness. Autonomy and relatedness are two basic human needs and cultural constructs at the same time. This implies that they may be differently defined yet remain equally important. The respective understanding of autonomy and relatedness is socialized during the everyday experiences of daily life routines from birth on. In this paper, two developmental pathways are portrayed that emphasize different conceptions of autonomy and relatedness that are adaptive in two different environmental contexts with very different affordances and constraints. Western middle-class children are socialized towards psychological autonomy, i.e. the primacy of own intentions, wishes, individual preferences and emotions affording a definition of relatedness as psychological negotiable construct. Non-Western subsistence farmer children are socialized towards hierarchical relatedness, i.e. positioning oneself into the hierarchical structure of a communal system affording a definition of autonomy as action oriented, based on responsibility and obligations. Infancy can be regarded as a cultural lens through which to study the different socialization agendas. Parenting strategies that aim at supporting these different socialization goals in German and Euro-American parents on the one hand and Nso farmers from North Western Cameroon on the other hand are described. It is concluded that different pathways need to be considered in order to understand human psychology from a global perspective.},

  abstract = {Although many scholars continue to describe cultural differences in terms of the individualism–collectivism distinction, unidimensional measures seem unlikely to capture the richness of cultural variation in parents’ socialization goals for their children. Kağıtçıbaşı’s (2009) theoretical model consists of a bidimensional approach with agency (autonomous to heteronomous) considered orthogonal to interpersonal distance (related to separate), yielding four quadrants. Kağıtçıbaşı argued that countries like the United States fit into the autonomous-separate quadrant, traditional “majority-world” cultures into the heteronomous-related quadrant, and educated urbanized cultural groups in majority-world societies into the autonomous-related quadrant. Given conceptual problems with the scales Kağıtçıbaşı used to measure these constructs, we developed, piloted, and validated the Related–Autonomous–Separate–Heteronomous (RASH) Scale and examined its psychometric properties and measurement invariance in a sample of Chinese (N\,=\,464) and North American (N\,=\,635) parents. Our results suggest that the four types of parental developmental goals (relatedness, separation, autonomy, and heteronomy) are not as neatly related as Kağıtçıbaşı’s model assumes; specifically, the Chinese and North American parents in our study highly valued both autonomous and related developmental goals. Our validation of the RASH scale is an important first step to develop a more appropriate measure of parental socialization goals for cross-cultural investigation.},

  abstract = {Parenting behaviors are studied through various qualitative and quantitative methods, including observations, interviews, and questionnaires, to identify both culturally specific and universal patterns of parents’ interactions with their offspring. However, these methods have rarely been combined to systematically investigate methodological convergence and divergence in capturing parenting dynamics. The present study employs a mixed method approach by including video observations, picture card interviews, and parenting ethnotheory questionnaires with a focus on a suburban Nso community in Cameroon, with 51 parents (Mage = 34 years; 43 mothers and eight fathers) of infants and toddlers (Mage = 8.2 months). Informed by Keller’s Component Model of Parenting, videos and interviews were coded for target parenting behaviors, including primary care, body contact, body stimulation, face-to-face context, object stimulation, and vocalization. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted for the parenting ethnotheory questionnaire items, alongside correlational analysis, to examine links between the three methods. Findings indicated minimal methodological convergence and ample divergence, suggesting that each method taps into distinct aspects of parenting without a unified representation. Within-method analyses, nonetheless, showed substantial correlations, particularly within observation and picture card interview methodologies. These findings are broadly consistent with the Component Model of Parenting but highlight the need for methodological diversity to capture the rich variation of parenting practices employed among cultural communities that are underrepresented in mainstream developmental research.
